# MonkeyBunchPluginDocs
Welcome to the **Monkey Bunch Plugin Documentation!**, here you will be able to find everything you need to create your first Monkey Bunch Plugin!
Monkey Bunch's Plugin system uses the lua coding language, if you wonder why? its because its easy for beginners and because I am too lazy to make a C# one!!

## Get Started
Create a .lua file and open it in your IDE of choice, Make sure it is inside of a folder called "MonkeyBunchPlugins" in your documents folder, And get coding! all of the official functions for the Update, OnApplicationQuit, etc. Functions are shown below.

## Functions
**GameTick** - Similar to the unity **Update()** function, gets called every frame/game tick.

**OnAppQuit** - Similar to the unity **OnApplicationQuit()** function, gets called whenever the game quits.
